Paradigm;Description;Main traits;Related paradigm(s);Critique;Examples
Imperative;Programs as statements that directly change computed state (datafields);Direct assignments, common data structure, global variable; ;Edsger W. Dijkstra, Michael A. Jackson;C, C++, Java, Kotlin, PHP, Python, Ruby
Structured;A style of imperative programming with more logical program structure;Structogram, indentation, no or limited use of goto statements;Imperative; ;C, C++, Java, Kotlin, Pascal,PHP, Python
Procedural;Derived from structured programming, based on the concept of modular programming or the procedure call;Local variable, sequence, selection, iteration, and modularization;Structured, imperative; ;C, C++, Lisp, PHP, Python
Functional;Treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions avoiding state and mutable data;Lambda calculus, compositionality, formula, recursion, referential transparency, no side effects;Declarative;;C++, Clojure, Coffeescript, Elixir, Erlang, F#, Haskell, Java (since version 8), Kotlin, Lisp, Python, R, Ruby, Scala, SequenceL, Standard ML, JavaScript, Elm
Event-driven including time-driven;Control flow is determined mainly by events, such as mouse click or interrupts including timer;Main loop, event handlers, asynchronous processes;Procedural, dataflow; ;JavaScript, ActionScript, Visual Basic, Elm
Object-oriented;Treats datafields as objects manipulated through predefined methods only;Objects, methods, message passing, information hiding, data abstraction, encapsulation, polymorphism, inheritance, serialization-marshalling;Procedural;Here and;Common Lisp, C++, C#, Eiffel, Java, Kotlin, PHP, Python, Ruby, Scala, JavaScript
Declarative;Defines program logic, but not detailed control flow;Fourth-generation languages, spreadsheet, report program generator; ; ;SQL, regular expression, Prolog, OWL, SPARQL
Automata-based programming;Treats programs as a model of a finite state machine or any other formal automata;State enumeration, control variable, state changes, isomorphism, state transition table;Imperative, event-driven; ;Abstract State Machine Language
